I downloaded all the images from unsplash.com except logo and menu icon.


The image I personally own:

* logo.png -- I used AI to synthesize the website logo.


The hamburger menu icon I downloaded from  http://fonts.google.com/icons ( It is used under the Apache License 2.0: https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/LICENSE):

* menu.png -- I used it as a dropdown menu button.
